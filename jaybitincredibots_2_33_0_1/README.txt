## ABOUT
####################################################################################
IncrediBots was originally designed by Ryan Clark, programmed by Oliver Trujillo,
with art from Matt Parry.  A big amount of credit should also go to Erin Catto and
the Box2D physics engine, as well as the Flash port of it upon which our game is
built.

IncrediBots is probably the game I've had the most fun working on.  It's been a
blast checking out all the crazy creations made by the IncrediBots community, and I
wish you all the best in keeping IncrediBots going.  Cheers and happy bot building!
